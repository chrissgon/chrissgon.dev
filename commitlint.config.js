// The commit convention (Conventional Commits), checked on each local commit message (.husky/commit-msg)
// and on each pull request title (.github/workflows/pr-title.yml): with squash merges, the pull request
// title becomes the commit title on main. Bodies carry tables, links and command output, so their line
// length is not limited; a subject may start with a product's name ("Perfect UI ..."), so its case is free.
